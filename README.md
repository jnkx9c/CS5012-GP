# CS5012-GP
Group Project for CS4012/CS5012

There are 2 branches for this project:
  <li>master</li>
  <li>develop</li>
 <br/>
 <p>All development work should be against the <b>develop</b> branch, so your IDE will need to be configured for this.</p>
 <p>To move code from <b>develop</b> to <b>master</b>, create a pull-request after the push(es).  It will be reviewed 
 before being merged to <b>master</b>.</p>
